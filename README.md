This project links in-game Minecraft with the web.

In Minecraft a ComputerCraft computer scans the player's inventory using a OpenCCSensors player sensor and sends the data to the Server.
The website then renders the inventory of the selected player onto a canvas.

A working example can be found here:

It works fine in IE and *should* work in FireFox and Chrome too.

If you find any Problems, please file it and contribute if you know how to fix it :)
